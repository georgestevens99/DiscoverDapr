# To produce the K8s Manifest on your dev system's command window, do the following after
# you have installed Helm 3, installed kubectl, and pointed kubectl at a running instance
# of kubernetes via the kubectl config command:

1. Clone the GitHub repo onto your dev system in any directory you wish, symbolically
named <File-Path-On-Your-Dev-Machine>


2. Open a Windows Command Window and submit the following command:

cd <File-Path-On-Your-Dev-Machine>\k8s-dapr-annotations-with-helm3\charts\blog-testsys


3. In the Windows Command Window, paste the following command and press Enter.  After a brief
wait the K8s Manifest generated by Helm (from the yaml templates and values files in the
above directory) will appear in the Command Window, along with other text.

#Note "--dry-run" only displays the generated K8s Manifest yaml to the command window.
#     To actually deploy the generated K8s Manifest, comment out or remove "--dry-run"

helm upgrade --install blog-testsys . --namespace default ^
--set app-servicea.image.tag="dev" --set app-serviceb.image.tag="dev" ^
--debug --dry-run
