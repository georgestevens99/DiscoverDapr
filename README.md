# DiscoverDapr
Will soon contain code samples showing how to use Dapr with C# and Visual Studio.  

The first code sample, grpc-pubsub-azservicebus, shows how to use a Dapr pub/sub component for the Azure Service Bus using a connection string for doing service to service pub/sub with a Test Client, and 2 gRPC services.

The second code sample, grpc-pubsub-azservicebus-clicreds, shows how to use a Dapr pub/sub component for the Azure Service Bus using the Confidential Client Credential Flow and Azure Active Directory Role Based Access Control (RBAC) for highly secure service to service pub/sub.  It has a Test Client and 2 gRPC services as well.
