# DiscoverDapr
This repo contains code samples showing how to use Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime) with Visual Studio, C#, ASP.NET Core, and gRPC services.  You can find out more about Dapr at the below links:
1.  My blog at https://dotnetsilverlightprism.wordpress.com/2021/01/08/discover-dapr-what-is-dapr-a-new-way-to-increase-developer-productivity/
2.  The official Dapr documentation at https://docs.dapr.io/.  A good place to start is with the Dapr Overview at https://docs.dapr.io/concepts/overview/.

The first code sample, **grpc-pubsub-azservicebus**, shows how to use a Dapr pub/sub component for the Azure Service Bus using a connection string for doing service to service pub/sub with a Test Client, and 2 gRPC services.

The second code sample, **grpc-pubsub-azservicebus-clicreds**, shows how to use a Dapr pub/sub component for the Azure Service Bus using the Confidential Client Credential Flow and Azure Active Directory Role Based Access Control (RBAC) for highly secure service to service pub/sub.  It has a Test Client and 2 gRPC services as well. (Code is NOT YET PRESENT).
