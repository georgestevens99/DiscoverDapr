# DiscoverDapr
Contains code samples showing how to use Dapr with C# and Visual Studio.  

The first code sample, **grpc-pubsub-azservicebus**, (Code is present and works. But InstallMe and ReadMe are under construction) shows how to use a Dapr pub/sub component for the Azure Service Bus using a connection string for doing service to service pub/sub with a Test Client, and 2 gRPC services.

The second code sample, **grpc-pubsub-azservicebus-clicreds**, (NOT YET PRESENT) shows how to use a Dapr pub/sub component for the Azure Service Bus using the Confidential Client Credential Flow and Azure Active Directory Role Based Access Control (RBAC) for highly secure service to service pub/sub.  It has a Test Client and 2 gRPC services as well.
