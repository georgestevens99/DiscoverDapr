# grpc-pubsub-azservicebus Installation Instructions
This will be written on Wed - Th 3/24/21 - 3/25/21.

## Prerequisites
Two prerequisites need to be fulfilled to use this code sample.
1. The free Microsoft Visual Studio Community Edition IDE (integrated development environment) needs to be installed on each machine that will run one of the services in the code sample.
2. You need to have a Microsoft Azure cloud subscription.  Free introductory subscriptions are available.

Get the free Visual Studio Community Edition IDE at this link:  https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/
* Note that you must **get Visual Studio Community and NOT Visual Studio Code**.  It takes a substantial amount of work to get the code sample to run using Visual Studio Code.  Don't bother!
