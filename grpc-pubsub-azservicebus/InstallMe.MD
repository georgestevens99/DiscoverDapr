# grpc-pubsub-azservicebus Installation Instructions
This will be written on Wed - Th 3/24/21 - 3/25/21.

## Prerequisites
Three prerequisites need to be fulfilled to use this code sample.
1. The free Microsoft Visual Studio Community IDE (integrated development environment) needs to be installed on *each machine* that will run one of the services in the code sample.

2. You need to have a Microsoft Azure cloud subscription.  Free introductory subscriptions are available.

3. Dapr needs to be installed on *each machine* that will run one of the services in the code sample. The code sample will work with any version of Dapr that is compatible with v1.0

**Visual Studio Community** -- Get the free Visual Studio Community IDE at this link:  https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/
* Note that you must **get Visual Studio Community and NOT Visual Studio Code**.  It takes a substantial amount of work to get the code sample to run using Visual Studio Code.  Don't bother!
  
**Azure subscription** -- Get a free Azure subscription at one of these links:
1. For Developers -- This subscription has some extra developer oriented features: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/dev-essentials/
2. For general use: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/ 
3. For Students -- This subscription does NOT require a credit card, unlike the 2 above.  But you must prove you are a student: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/

**Dapr** -- Install Dapr on each machine that runs one of the services in the code sample by following the instructions at this link:
